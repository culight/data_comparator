# Data Comparator

## Overview
Data Comparator is a data profiling tool for quick and modular profiling of two datasets. The primary inspiration for this project was to be able to quickly compare two datasets from a number of different formats with each other, but a range of capabilities have been implemented. 

Data Comparator would be useful for the following scenarios:
    - Compare old/new (or original/modified) datasets to find general differences
    - Routine EDA of a dataframe
    - Compare two datasets of different formats
    - Profile a dataset during interactive debugging
    - Compare various columns within the same dataset
    - Modify and reload a dataset
