# Data Comparator

## Overview
This project was initiated to implement a data profiling tool for quick and modular profiling of multiple datasets. The primary inspiration for this project was to be able to quickly compare two datasets from any common format with each other, but a range of capabilities have been implemented. Data Comparator would also be useful for the following scenarios:
    - Compare old/new (or original/modified) datasets to find general differences
    - Routine testing of a dataframe
    - Compare datasets of different formats
    - Profile a dataset during interactive debugging
    - Compare columns of the same dataset
    - Modify and reload a dataset
